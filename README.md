Hi I'm Josh!

I recently graduated from Queen’s University with a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) degree, specializing in Software Design. Over the past few years, I have really enjoyed learning and practicing full-stack web development in my freetime. 

One thing I particularly enjoy about web development is that there’s always something new to learn or improve upon. The endless possibilities keep me motivated to continue creating and working on my skills.

Feel free to message me, I’m always open to chat and explore new opportunities.
